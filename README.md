# AP Comp Sci Final Project: Game of Ten 

<h3>Plot Overview:</h3>
It is the year 2020. You are a genius inventor renowned worldwide for your intellect and skill. An alien species from outer space is coming to invade Earth, and the only way that it can be stopped is through a machine that you have created that has the ability to defeat the aliens. Unfortunately, through their intelligence, they have found out about the device and plan to destroy the machine. The machine requires some time to power up, so you use another device that you have created, a signal jammer, to prevent the aliens from discovering the location of the machine. You have displaced the signal into 10 different locations, with one being the correct location. Before the aliens have a chance to discover the location, you have the option of transporting it to any of the other 9 locations. Unfortunately, every time they pinpoint the correct location or anywhere close to it, their sensors become more knowledgeable of how to locate the machine. It is your job to stand your ground long enough for the machine to collect enough energy to start working. 
<h3>Game Overview:</h3>
There are two players: one human player and a computer. The player is on the defending side, while the computer is on the attacking side. The player must choose a number for the computer to guess.
